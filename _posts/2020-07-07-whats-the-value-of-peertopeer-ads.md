title:  What's the value of peer-to-peer Ads?
categories: [Insight]
excerpt: #### Great question! Let's look into the value proposition of P2P Ads.
---
The peer-to-peer (P2P) concept became popular around the year 2000, music-sharing was a big craze with the likes of Napster. P2P allowed users to connect directly to a service without an intermediary or client-server model. <br>
Step into the current ages where large free platforms/corporations, that own user’s data, compete for advertising revenue and are essentially middlemen that receive fees for all transactions. Those corporations mostly dominate both the user data, fee and Ad market.<br>

Now imagine removing the middlemen, costs and data mining… <br>

**P2P advertisements are competitive, and here is why;**
-	Ad Payments: Receive 100% of payment.
-	Ad management: Website owner has direct full control of the management of ads.<br>

**So now include Open Source code, Blockchain and P2P, additional benefits appear;**
-	Zero license costs to operate an Ad network.
-	Low transaction fees, fraction of a $ cent for each Ad sent.
-	Send an Advertisement and payment simultaneously in one transaction.
-	Blockchain wallet, owner has 100% access and each Ad gets paid directly.
-	Payments are anonymous, no private information leakage.
